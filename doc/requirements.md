# Requirements So Far

You have a toy robot that roams around a table top. 
It responds to the following series of commands, that for the time being can be methods on a class.

* Place(x, y, direction_facing) - Places the robot at the position X, Y and facing either North, South, East, or West. If the robot has already been placed, another place command can be called to place the robot at the new location

* Move - Moves the robot forward in the direction they are facing.

* Left - Rotates the robot 90 degrees to the left without changing the position of the robot

* Right - Rotates the robot 90 degrees to the right without changing the position of the robot

* Report - Announces the X, Y position and facing direction of the robot (for now this can just be output to the command line or return a string)
