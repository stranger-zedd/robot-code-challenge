Robot Code Challenge
====================

This is a learning project suggested by Ryan. I did it in Clojure, which I
didn't know (very much) before starting this project; please forgive my lack
of idiomacy.

Things I learned so far:
* Clojure, while it has s-expressions, is _not_ very lispy, and appears to be going for a more functional approach to programming
* You still have to jump through quite a few hoops for the JVM
* You can't _use_ anaphors in your macros, you can only introduce them.
